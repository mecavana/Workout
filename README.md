# Workouts

This workout application was designed to be able to easily view different types of workouts based on body part and/or resistance type.  It also has the ability to view previous workouts and add new ones to the database.

Note: This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.6.

## Development server


Navgiate to the `services` directory and set the `FLASK_RUN` environment variable to `workouts.py`.  Then run `flask run` to start the Python backend.  

Navigate back to the main `Workout` directory and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
